# Advanced-Robotic-Arm-PID-Control-Project
In progess

This project demonstrates a 5-DOF robotic arm designed and built from scratch with a custom planetary gearbox and integrated PID feedback control system.  
Developed using Arduino and C++, the system uses rotary encoders and pressure sensors for precise joint positioning and adaptive grip control.

**Features**
- 5-DOF robotic arm designed in Fusion 360
- Custom 16:1 planetary gearbox for improved torque
- PID control for position feedback and stability
- Pressure sensing system for adaptive grip control
- Encoder-based position tracking
- Modular 3D-printed components

**Hardware:** Arduino Uno, MG996R Servos, Rotary Encoders, Voltage Sensors  
**Software:** C++, Arduino IDE, Altium Designer, Fusion 360, ROS2 (in progress)

---

**Control Overview**

The PID controller continuously adjusts motor signals based on encoder feedback to maintain target joint angles with minimal overshoot and steady-state error.

---

**3D Models**
All CAD and STL files for mechanical components are available under the `/3d_models` folder.  
You can view them directly in GitHub or download them for 3D printing.

**Future Work**
- Implementing the PID system via the rotary encoders and servos
- Implement ROS2 simulation and path planning  
- Add inverse kinematics and trajectory generation  
- Integrate computer vision for object tracking
